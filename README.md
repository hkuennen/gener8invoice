# Gener8Invoice

## Philosophy

Gener8Invoice builds upon [simpleinv](https://github.com/hkuennen/simpleinv), addressing its limitations while maintaining a lightweight and efficient approach. The original terminal-based app lacked the ability to interact with PDFs, making it less flexible for real-world invoicing needs.

With Gener8Invoice, users can now create dynamic invoices with multiple line items—just as they would expect from a WYSIWYG application.

This app provides a simple, efficient, and cross-platform solution for generating invoices. Many existing invoicing tools are either too complex, require subscriptions, or lack offline functionality. Gener8Invoice offers a streamlined, user-friendly experience by integrating a robust Django backend with a modern React frontend, while also supporting a desktop version via Electron.
